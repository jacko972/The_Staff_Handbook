## 2.1.Holiday Entitlement

### INTRODUCTION

The Company encourages everyone to take regular time off during the calendar year, and as such provides everyone with a paid holiday entitlement.  

### KEY POINTS

* The holiday year commences on 1st Jan and ends on 31st Dec. 

* Your total entitlement will increase by 1 day per year to a maximum of 25 days per annum.  To be eligible for the incremental day, you must have been employed by the Company on a full-time basis by 1 March of the previous year.   For example, if your start date was 1 Feb 2013, you will be eligible for an incremental day in 2014; if your start date was 1 Nov 2013, you will not be eligible for an additional day until 2015.  Any previous, non-standard leave arrangements will be considered when calculating the accrual of additional days and may impact the accrual.

* All holiday applications need to be approved by your line manager and holidays need to be arranged at mutually convenient times.  You must apply at least 3 weeks before the proposed holiday start date.

* For individuals who join during the year, entitlement will be accrued in proportion to the completed calendar months worked.

* Continuous duration of the holiday should not exceed two weeks. Under special circumstances exceptions may be arranged with your line manager.

* Holiday entitlement not taken in any calendar year may not be carried forward to the next year or be compensated by payment in lieu.

* Upon termination of your contract, payment will be made for accrued holiday based on 1/12th of annual entitlement for each complete calendar month worked during the current holiday year, less any holiday already taken.

### PROCESS FOR TAKING HOLIDAY

All applications should be made by calendar invite and email request to your line manager. Your line manager will approve/decline the request by accepting the calendar invite and sending you email confirmation.
