# 3.0 Pay & Benefits

## 3.1. Pay & Performance Review Policy

### INTRODUCTION

There are three principles driving our policies on performance reviews and compensation. Those are: 

* compensation should be closely tied to performance 

* compensation should be compatible with local market rates 

* regular performance feedback is essential

The review cycle provides a formalized process for evaluation and feedback on work performance, ensuring that individuals knows what they are doing well and where there is a need for improvement.  The performance review discussions give the opportunity to take a step back from the day to day activities and through a free and open discussion, evaluate job performance, establish targets and objectives for the future, identify specific needs to help achieve these objectives and thereby assist ongoing career development.

### **KEY POINTS** 

* Salaries are paid on a monthly basis, usually around the last Friday of each month.

* You are responsible for providing your bank details to Richard Harvey or Matthew Barker at the start of your contract.

* Once your contract and pay have been established in a given currency, we will not change that currency.

* Every individual will receive an informal review 3 months after joining. In addition, we will conduct semi-annual performance reviews in May and November.  Individuals in special circumstances or having performance issues may be reviewed with greater frequency. 

* Payment reviews and bonuses are tied to individual performance, to performance in comparison to your peers, and to overall company performance. Increases are not guaranteed and are provided solely at management's discretion. 

### PROCESS

You will receive email notification from your line manager about the timetable and process for performance reviews.
