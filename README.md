### INTRODUCTION

There are three principles driving our policies on performance reviews and compensation. Those are:

* regular performance feedback is essential

The review cycle provides a formalized process for evaluation and feedback on work performance, ensuring that individuals knows what they are doing well and where there is a need for improvement.  The performance review discussions give the opportunity to take a step back from the day to day activities and through a free and open discussion, evaluate job performance, establish targets and objectives for the future, identify specific needs to help achieve these objectives and thereby assist ongoing career development.

* Every individual will receive an informal review 3 months after joining. In addition, we will conduct semi-annual performance reviews in May and November.  Individuals in special circumstances or having performance issues may be reviewed with greater frequency. 

* Payment reviews and bonuses are tied to individual performance, to performance in comparison to your peers, and to overall company performance. Increases are not guaranteed and are provided solely at management's discretion. 

### PROCESS

You will receive email notification from your line manager about the timetable and process for performance reviews.

### INTRODUCTION

All individuals have a right to a working environment free from harassment.  The Company is committed to providing a workplace in which the dignity of individuals is respected.

### KEY POINTS

* The Company explicitly prohibits all forms of harassment, victimisation and bullying.  It is wholly unacceptable behaviour and is regarded as a serious breach of discipline.

* Harassment can take many forms and may involve unwelcome conduct of a physical, verbal or non-verbal nature which the recipient finds offensive, intimidating or hostile and affects their dignity at work.

* Harassment may involve a single incident or persistent behaviour that extends over a period of time.  It may be related to age, sex, race, disability, religion, nationality or any personal characteristic of an individual.

* Harassment and bullying can occur face to face, by written communications, electronic communications or telephone.

* All individuals have a clear role to play in helping to create a climate at work in which harassment and bullying behaviour is unacceptable. In particular, individuals should be aware of their own conduct, avoid colluding with inappropriate behaviour and co-operate fully in any complaint procedure.

* This policy covers bullying or harassment, which occurs both in the workplace itself and in settings outside the workplace, such as business trips, events or social functions.

* Managers have a responsibility to raise awareness of the issue, respond positively to any complaints ad challenge and stop unacceptable behaviour.

### PROCESS

Informal

* In the first instance, if an individual feels that they are being bullied or harassed, they should initially attempt to resolve the problem by explaining to the person responsible that their behaviour is not welcome and that it offends or makes the individual feel uncomfortable.  It is possible that the person may be unaware of the effect of their actions and the problem may be resolved by having an informal discussion..

Formal

* If the conduct continues, or if it is not appropriate to resolve it informally due to the nature of the bullying or harassment or because the individual does not feel able to talk directly with the person creating the problem, the individual should raise their complaint in writing to their line manager or a senior manageer.

## 4.4 DISCIPLINARY & DISMISSAL POLICY AND   PROCEDURE

### INTRODUCTION

The Company's aim is to encourage and help individuals to reach the necessary standards of conduct and performance. This procedure sets out the Company's approach for dealing with disciplinary issues.

Before taking formal disciplinary action every effort will be made to resolve the matter by informal discussions with an individual.  Only where this fails to bring about the desired improvement will the formal disciplinary procedure be implemented.

Examples of General Disciplinary Offences:

* Poor timekeeping and/or attendance.

* Poor work standard (where no progress has been made despite appropriate guidance, coaching and training) or inadequate attention to work.

* Disruptive or unacceptable behaviour.

* Unauthorised and unreasonable absence from work.

* Failure to comply with Company rules.

**Note:**  This list is for example only and is not exhaustive.

### KEY POINTS

If you are subject to disciplinary action:

* The procedure is designed to establish the facts quickly and to deal consistently with disciplinary issues.  No disciplinary action will be taken until the matter has been fully investigated.

* At every stage you will be advised of the nature of the complaint in writing and will be invited to attend a meeting (which may take the form of an in-person or telephone meeting) to discuss the issue.  At any stage you will be given the opportunity to be accompanied at the meeting.  At the meeting you will be given the opportunity to state your case and present any evidence.

* You will not be dismissed for a first breach of discipline except in the case of gross misconduct, when the penalty will normally be dismissal without notice and without pay in lieu of notice.

* You have the right to appeal against any disciplinary action taken against you.

* The procedure may be implemented at any stage if your alleged misconduct warrants such action.

* If you request, you have the right to be accompanied at a disciplinary hearing by a fellow worker.

### PROCESS

**Formal Warning**

There are three levels of warning:

1. Verbal Warning

2. Written Warning

3. Final Written Warning

Normally for a first offence, a verbal warning will be given.  However, if the misconduct is considered more serious, but not serious enough to be considered gross misconduct, a written or final written warning may be given.

A written confirmation of any warning issued will be given to the individual, detailing clear remedial action and/or any objectives to be met, along with details of the appeals procedure (as detailed below).  The individual will also be made aware of how long the warning will remain in effect and the likely penalty for repetition.

**Gross Misconduct**

If, after investigation, it is confirmed that an individual has committed an offence that constitutes gross misconduct, the normal consequence will be dismissal without notice or payment in lieu of notice.  While the alleged gross misconduct is being investigated, the individual may be suspended, during which time he or she will be paid their normal pay rate.  Any decision to dismiss will be taken by the Company only after full investigation.

Examples of Gross Misconduct:

* Theft

* Damage to  Company Property

* Fraud

* Incapacity for work due to being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs

* Physical Violence

* Bullying

* Gross Insubordination. 

**Note:  **This list is for example only and is not exhaustive.

**Dismissal or Action Short of Dismissal**

Following a final written warning, where conduct or performance has failed to improve or a further offence of a similar kind occurs, a demotion or dismissal may follow.

Where an act of gross misconduct has been committed dismissal may follow.

In such circumstances the following procedure will apply; the individual:

* will receive written confirmation setting out the allegation and the basis for it;

* will be invited to a meeting (which may take the form of an in-person or telephone meeting) to discuss the allegation; and 

* will be given the right of appeal including an appeal meeting.

The individual has a right to be accompanied by a fellow worker at any meeting held to discuss the termination of his/her employment.

**Appeals Procedure**

If an individual wishes to appeal against any disciplinary action taken, an appeal must be made in writing to senior management, within five working days of the decision being communicated.  Where possible a senior manager who was not involved in the original disciplinary action will hear the appeal and decide the case as impartially as possible.

## 4.5 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

### INTRODUCTION

It is the Company's policy to ensure that individuals with a grievance relating to their employment can use a procedure which can help to resolve grievances as quickly and as fairly as possible.

### PROCESS

**Stage 1**

If you have a grievance about your employment you should, in the first instance, discuss it informally with your line manager.  We hope that the majority of concerns will be resolved at this stage.  In the circumstance that your grievance is directly related to your immediate line manager, you should address your grievance to your immediate line manager's line manager.

**Stage 2**

If you feel that the matter has not been resolved through informal discussions, you should put your grievance in writing to your line manager.  Your grievance will then be investigated and, as part of the investigation, you will be invited to a meeting in order to discuss the problem (which may take the form of an in-person or telephone meeting), normally within 5 working days of receipt of the grievance letter.  You will have the right to be accompanied by a fellow worker, or a nominated person of your choice. The meeting may be postponed for up to 5 days after the date originally set in the event that your companion is unable to attend.

If necessary, your manager may adjourn the meeting in order to make further investigations.

Once due consideration has been given to the grievance, your manager will respond in writing to you, usually within 5 working days of the meeting.  Where a decision has not been reached in that time, you will be given an explanation for the delay and told when a response can be expected. Your manager will also notify you of the right to appeal against the decision if you are not satisfied with it.

At stages 1 and 2 of the grievance procedure, in the circumstance that your grievance is directly related to your immediate line manager, you should address your grievance to the manager of your immediate line manager.

**Stage 3**

If the matter is not resolved to your satisfaction following the completion of the process outlined above, you should put the grievance in writing to a manager who is senior to the manager that heard your original grievance.  You will be entitled to have a meeting (which may take the form of an in-person or telephone meeting) with the senior manager to discuss the matter.  The senior manager will give his/her decision within seven working days of the grievance being received.  The senior manager's decision will be final.

**GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT**

In the event that you have left the company at the time where you either:

* Wish to raise a grievance 

* Have raised a grievance which is being pursued via the standard company grievance  procedure

You may either raise or continue to pursue that grievance following standard procedures set out above or agree in writing to the use of the following alternative procedure.

Under the alternative procedure, you must put your grievance in writing to your line manager (or if the complaint concerns that individual, to their manager). The relevant manager will then investigate the grievance and respond to you in writing usually within 5 days of its receipt. The decision of the relevant manager will be final.

## 4.9 PRE-EMPLOYMENT SCREENING POLICY

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the qualifications and backgrounds of job candidates are adequately screened before offers of employment are extended. 

**APPLICABLE TO**

This policy applies to all final candidates for posted positions.

**POLICY**

It is the Companyâ€™s policy that all prudent measures be taken to select and hire the best qualified candidate for any given position. The goal of this policy is to ensure that key organizational assets - including human resources - are protected, that a safe work environment is maintained, and that hiring managers are well equipped to make employment decisions based on a thorough evaluation of applicant-related information. 

Therefore, all final candidates for employment will be required to undergo and successfully complete pre-employment screening prior to their being hired. 

**PROCEDURES**

Pre-employment screening for any final job candidate will include: 

**Form of Screening                                                  		Responsibility** 

Reference checks                                                       	Hiring department 

Confirmation of individual identity                     		Senior Management 

Verification of eligibility of right to work in specified country	Senior Management

Other pre-employment screening shall be conducted on an as-needed basis. For example:

* Verification of licensure and/or certification required for the job shall be the responsibility of the individual hiring departments.

* Employees who are expected to work for extended periods on-site at customer or partner facilities may be required to undergo more extensive screening to meet local requirements of that facility. The identification of such a need will be responsibility of the hiring department; the conduct of the screening will be the responsibility of HR. This screening will cover crimes involving taking money/property, crimes involving violence, crimes involving homicide (murder), crimes involving a sexual nature, crimes involving moral turpitude, crimes involving drugs, and crimes involving immigration violations.

After a final candidate is selected to fill an open position, hiring units will request references from the candidate, and check at least 2 of those references. 

Once hiring departments have notified Senior Management that final candidates have successfully completed the pre-screening process, Senior Management may extend offers of employment. Even if an offer of employment is extended prior to the requisite pre-screening being conducted, that offer will be withdrawn should a candidate fail to successfully complete the pre-screening process.

**INELIGIBILITY FOR HIRE**

Evidence that a candidate does not pass any of the applicable screening  may deem that individual ineligible for hire at the Company. 

Any final candidate who has provided inaccurate or misleading information on his or her employment application with regard to identity, convictions, education, and/or certifications, will be considered ineligible for hire; internal candidates providing such information may be terminated. 

Offers of employment may be withdrawn if prospective employees knowingly withhold information or provide false or misleading information, and employment may be terminated should any subsequent information come to light once they have been appointed.

This policy will be reviewed to respond to any changes and whenever there is a need to comply with new legislation or codes of practice.
